> ### Serverless Node.js + TS + CQRS + ES + DDD + FP codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc.) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Serverless Node.js + Typescript.
It includes such cool patterns as CQRS, EventSourcing and DDD with functional programming flavor!

# ![RealWorld Example App](docs/wow.png)

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the Node.ts + TS community styleguides & best practices.
